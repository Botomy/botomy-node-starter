# botomy-node-starter

Starter project for running a [Botomy](http://botomy.vercel.app) node player.

This uses `fastify` as the server. It is set up to listen to `post` requests on port `3000`.

Modify the `play` function in `src/play.ts` to write your bot code.

# Setup

Use this repo as a template

```
npm install
```

# RUN

Starts a server on port 3000 and calls the `play` function in `src/play.ts`

```
npm start
```

Hot reload:

```
npm run dev
```
